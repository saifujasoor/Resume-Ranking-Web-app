* The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* The backend is built using Flask, PIL and Open CV

## Introduction

A python web app for analysing resumes/ CVs  that best match the position.which help employers by analysing resumes and CVs, rank the candidates resume based on estimated job description. In this project i have used KNN concept along with recommendation engine techniques such as Collaborative , Content-Based filtering for fuzzy matching job description with multiple resumes.



### What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision is the field of study that enables computers to see and identify digital images and videos as a human would. The challenges it faces largely follow from the limited understanding of biological vision. Computer Vision involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images to extract high-dimensional data from the real world in order to generate symbolic or numerical information which can then be used to make decisions. The process often includes practices like object recognition, video tracking, motion estimation, and image restoration.

### What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. It supports the Deep Learning frameworks TensorFlow, Caffe, and PyTorch.

## What is KNN?

The abbreviation KNN stands for “K-Nearest Neighbour”. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements.
The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol ‘K’.

NearestNeighbors implements unsupervised nearest neighbors learning. It acts as a uniform interface to three different nearest neighbors algorithms: BallTree, KDTree, and a brute-force algorithm based on routines in sklearn.metrics.pairwise.
