# Resume-Ranking-Web-app

## Introduction

A python web app for analysing resumes/ CVs  that best match the position.which help employers by analysing resumes and CVs, rank the candidates resume based on estimated job description. In this project i have used KNN concept along with recommendation engine techniques such as Collaborative , Content-Based filtering for fuzzy matching job description with multiple resumes.

## KNN

The abbreviation KNN stands for “K-Nearest Neighbour”. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements.
The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol ‘K’.

NearestNeighbors implements unsupervised nearest neighbors learning. It acts as a uniform interface to three different nearest neighbors algorithms: BallTree, KDTree, and a brute-force algorithm based on routines in sklearn.metrics.pairwise.
